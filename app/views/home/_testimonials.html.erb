I owe it to the mentors and technical staff who were really helpful and friendly.<br><br>They introduced us to new technologies and concepts and their experience definitely guided us to convert our ideas into the final product. <br><br>I'll admit that sitting continuously, staring at the screen and typing does get stressful at times, but the organisation saw to it that each participant was made as comfortable as possible. <br><br>The food was amazing and the organisers made sure that there were no technical shortcomings. I also got to meet students from colleges all around Mumbai, which was a great opportunity for me to share ideas and learn about new things.<br>" href="/read_more">Read More</a>
